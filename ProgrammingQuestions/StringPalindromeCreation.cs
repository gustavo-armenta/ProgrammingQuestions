A palindrome is a string which reads the same forward and backwards. You are provided a function shortPalin which accepts a string S.
You are required to form a palindrome by adding 0 or more characters to the string at any location which you find appropriate. Return the minimum number of characters which needs to be added to the string to transform it into a palindrome. The section of the program which parses the input and displays the output is already written. Your task is to complete the body of the function provided, and to return the correct output.
 
Constraints:
The string S may consist of up to 1000 characters.  
String contains only lowercase english alphabets.  
Sample input #1: 
S = "abab"
Sample output #1:
1
Explanation #1:
A palindrome can be obtained by appending an 'a' to the end of the string to form 'ababa'.
Sample input #2: 
S = "abacaba"
Sample output #2:
0
Explanation #2:
The string is already a palindrome, so no characters need to be added to it.
